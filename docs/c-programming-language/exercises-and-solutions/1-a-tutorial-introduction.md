## Exercise 1-10

> Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each
> tab by `\t`, each backspace by `\b`, and each backslash by `\\`. This makes tabs
> and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 20'></BibRef>

## Exercise 1-11

> How would you test the word count program? What kinds of

## Exercise 1-13

> Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in
> its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical
> orientation is more challenging. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 24'></BibRef>

## Exercise 1-16

> Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will
> correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible
> of the text. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 30'></BibRef>

## Exercise 1-18

> Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each
> line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 31'></BibRef>

### My solution

## Exercise 1-19

> Write a function `reverse(s)` that reverses the character
> string `s`. Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 31'></BibRef>

### My solution

## Exercise 1-20

> Write a program `detab` that replaces tabs in the input with the
> proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of
> tab stops, say every $n$ columns. Should $n$ be a variable or a symbolic parameter? <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 34'></BibRef>

### My solution

tbd

### Official solution

tbd

## Exercise 1-21

> Write a program `entab` that replaces strings of blanks by the
> minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the
> same tab stops as for `detab`. When either a tab or a single blank would suffice
> to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference? <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 34'></BibRef>

## Exercise 1-22

> Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more
> shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the $n$th
> column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very
> long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 34'></BibRef>

## Exercise 1-23

> Write a program to remove all comments from a C program.
> Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments
> do not nest. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 34'></BibRef>

### My solution

### Official solution

tbd

## Exercise 1-24

> Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax
> errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about
> quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments. (This program
> is hard if you do it in full generality.) <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 34'></BibRef>
